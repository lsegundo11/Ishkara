# Velkynvelve

## Description
The drow outpost is located high in a cavern, built 100 feet above the rocky floor. The outpost consists of a series of small caves in the cavern walls and four “hanging towers” — hollowed-out stalactites connected by walkways, stairs, and rope bridges. The towers are concealed by the thick webs of giant spiders stretched below them, so that only the lowermost parts of the stalactites are visible from the cavern floor.

With the small amount of dim light used in the outpost shielded from the cavern floor below, one might walk the entire length of the cleft without becoming aware of the outpost overhead, hidden in the darkness above the range of torches and lanterns. The giant spiders also serve as guards, dropping down on their web strands to prey upon creatures that find their way into the cavern. Similarly, drow warriors can drop to the cave floor on lines of spider silk to ambush enemies.

Three caves and two hanging towers surrounding a platform make up the main part of the outpost for the drow warriors. The largest of the hanging towers is reserved for the priestesses and the shrine of Lolth, while the other is a guard tower opposite the cave used to hold slaves. North of the slave pen is the den of the outpost’s quaggoth servants. Watch posts lie at either end of the outpost, near the northern and southern entrances to the cavern.

**VELKYNVELVE: GENERAL FEATURES**

The following features apply throughout the outpost.

**Light.** The interior spaces of the outpost are dimly illuminated by lanterns containing phosphorescent fungi, while the exterior is dark.

**Sound.** A small waterfall pouring into the cavern creates a constant background noise, negating the cave’s tendency to amplify and carry sounds. Checks made to hear things in the cavern are made normally.

**Stairs.** These 5-foot-wide stairs are carved into the stone sides of the cavern between several of the cave entrances.

**Bridges.** Bridges of spider-silk rope connect the walkways to the guard tower and the entrance to the priestess’s tower. The swaying bridges are difficult terrain for non-drow.

**Falling.** A creature pushed off the stairs, a bridge, or the edge of a platform must attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature falls, landing in the webs stretched beneath the outpost. On a successful save, a creature grabs hold of the edge and hangs there until it can climb back up with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check made as part of its movement. A failed Strength check means the creature is unable to move and must check again, while failure by 5 or more means a fall to the webs.

**Webs.** The dense webs of giant spiders kept by the drow conceal the outpost from below. A creature falling into the webs becomes restrained. As an action, a restrained creature can attempt a DC 12 Strength check to break free from the webs. The webs can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10, 15 hp per 10-foot section, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). Each foot of movement in the webs costs 1 extra foot, and any creature other than a spider that enters the webs or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Strength or Dexterity check to avoid becoming restrained. Any movement in the webs attracts the attention of the giant spiders, which attack and feed on trapped creatures.

A creature falling from the webbing to the cavern floor takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage.

## Areas of Velkynvelve
### 1. Southern Watch Post
Near the southern passage from the cavern is an alcove used as a watch post.

Two drow are stationed here at all times, keeping watch over the passage and noting the approach of any creatures. The duty is long and dull, so the watchers are sometimes distracted. A successful Dexterity (Stealth) check made against the guards’ passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 allows characters to pass unnoticed. Any light from the passage or the cavern below automatically draws the guards’ attention, however.

The drow guards are under orders to report intruders immediately, and to keep them under observation. They take no other action unless ordered or unless they see signs of a significant threat. In that case, they blow a high, shrill note on a warning trumpet to alert the whole outpost.
### 2. Barracks
Stone steps lead from the watch post to a 1-foot-thick platform of zurkhwood (see “Fungi of the Underdark” earlier in chapter 2) extending between two of the hanging towers and into three adjoining caverns.

The two southernmost caves serve as barracks for the rank-and-file drow warriors of the outpost. Six warriors dwell in each barracks, each set up with a pallet, a small zurkhwood chest for holding personal possessions and equipment, and a side table. Spider silk rope webbing on the cavern walls is set with hooks for hanging lanterns and other items, but the barracks are rarely lit.

One drow is present in each of the barracks caves at any time, resting in a meditative trance. A resting drow rises at any significant light or noise, ready to attack.
Treasure

The equipment of the resting drow is stored under his pallet: a shortsword, a hand crossbow with a case of 20 hand crossbow bolts, a chain shirt, and a 100-foot coil of silk rope with a small grappling hook at the end.

Each of the six chests in each barracks contains a flask of drow poison used to treat crossbow bolts (see “Poisons” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). One flask has enough poison to treat 20 bolts. Each chest also contains two sets of clothing and 1d4 items from the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook.
