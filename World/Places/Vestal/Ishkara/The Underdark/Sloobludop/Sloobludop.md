## Description

>
>**Defense**: All kuo-toa rally to the village’s defense, including whips and monitors serving the priesthood.
>
>**Commerce**: The kuo-toa trade with various races of the Underdark near the Darklake, in addition to providing ferry service and navigation.
>
>**Organizations**: Two major shrines and several other minor ones.

Sloobludop is a kuo-toa village on the eastern edge of the Darklake. From a distance, it looks like a massive tangle of reeds stretching up into the darkness, lit by glowing spots of phosphorescence. Upon closer approach, a series of rickety towers can be seen, lashed together by rope and plank bridges set in haphazard patterns. Even above ground, the kuo-toa build in line with their three-dimensional aquatic sensibilities, constructing their “great city” as if it were underwater.

Sloobludop simmers with religious fervor and sectarian tension. While many of the kuo-toa still worship the goddess Blibdoolpoolp, a faction has shifted its worship to Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father, a vision influenced by the manifestation of the demon prince [[Demogorgon]] from the depths of the Darklake. Initially, the archpriest of Blibdoolpoolp tolerated this — but then his own daughter declared herself an archpriest of Leemooggoogoon, and the cult began to grow.

>**SLOOBLUDOP: GENERAL FEATURES**
>
>Sloobludop spreads out along the rocky shore of the waters of a broad cavern lake, with high fences of woven netting to the north and south of the village boundaries.
>
>**Light**. Sloobludop’s cavern is almost entirely dark except for a few spots of dim light from phosphorescent fungus and coral, or from glowing cave-fish glands. The kuo-toa recoil from areas of bright illumination, becoming hostile if bright light is brought among them.
>
>**Bridges and Platforms**. Bridges and platforms are haphazardly strung throughout the city, connecting various levels of structures with each other as well as crisscrossing open spaces. Characters can move at a normal pace across the platforms and bridges, but this puts strain on their poor construction. Whenever one or more characters move at normal speed across a bridge or platform, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, a bridge flips or breaks to drop characters to the platform below, or a platform tilts to tip the characters into the water. These areas can be navigated safely by treating them as difficult terrain.
>
>**Language**. None of the inhabitants of Sloobludop speak Common or any surface-world language, which might present a challenge for the characters. The fish-folk speak Undercommon, and Stool the myconid sprout can establish communication using its rapport spores if it is present. Shuushar the kuo-toa monk can also translate if he accompanies the party.

## Included locales:
### 1. Sloobludop - Gate
Sloobludop is enclosed to the north and south by outer “walls” of heavy netting with sharp bone hooks woven into them. In the middle of each wall is a gate through which creatures can safely pass. Any creature wishing to crawl through the netting can do so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 piercing damage and becomes restrained in the netting, requiring a successful DC 12 Strength check as an action to break free.

Stationed outside each gate are four kuo-toa whips. They confront anyone who approaches. Party members escorted by other kuo-toa can pass through the gate unchallenged. If the characters are unescorted, any kuo-toa they meet attempt to capture them. Roll a d20. On a 1–7, captives are taken to area 3. On an 8–18, captives are taken to area 4. On a 19–20, the guards are evenly split and immediately begin to brawl for the right to take the characters as prisoners.
### 2. Sloobludop - Docks
A half-dozen kuo-toan keelboats are moored here. Although kuo-toa will negotiate terms for ferrying the characters across the Darklake, none leave without permission (see below). Party members can attempt to steal one or more of the boats, but doing so requires a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) check (and the kuo-toa are able to sense invisible creatures). The kuo-toa pursue any stolen boats, intending to capture the thieves as offerings to appease their gods.

Five groups of three kuo-toa monitors led by a kuo-toa whip patrol the platforms at the water’s edge. They ensure no vessel enters or leaves without submitting to “auguries” to determine if a crew’s actions are pleasing to the god of the hour — in this case, the Deep Father.

The auguries consist of a half-hour ritual, during which the whip casts bones, shells, and other tokens and reads the resulting omens. Roll a d20. On 1–8, the whip finds the omens favorable; on 9–18, he finds them unfavorable; and on 19–20, the auguries are unclear, and the whip feels the need to consult the archpriest of the Deep Father (area 4).

If the characters met or spoke with the archpriest of the Deep Father before coming here, the whip automatically refuses their request to leave.
### 3. Sloobludop - Shrine of the Sea Mother
When the characters arrive here, on their own or escorted, read the following to the players:
>A nine-foot-tall statue stands here. Its body is roughly carved from some kind of wood in the shape of a humanoid female, its head and forearms formed from the severed head and claws of a giant albino crayfish. These parts are lashed on with strands of gut, and emit an overpowering stench of rotting shellfish. Shells, brightly colored stones, mushrooms, and rotting fish are piled at the statue’s feet and strung in garlands around its neck. Four stern kuo-toa slowly circle the statue, alert and on guard, while a few others mill about, gazing up at the statue and bowing repeatedly while chanting.

All creatures that come here are expected to make an offering to the Great Sea Mother Blibdoolpoolp. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check recalls that Blibdoolpoolp is a scavenger goddess, meaning that discarded and recovered items are worthy offerings — and the more personal the better. Regurgitating at the goddess’s feet is considered a sincere show of faith (and a behavior faithful kuo-toa might display if the characters wait long enough).

Four kuo-toa monitors guard the statue at all times, and there are always 2d4 kuo-toa worshipers around it offering prayers. Currently the shrine is tended by Glooglugogg, a kuo-toa whip and son of Ploopploopeen, the archpriest of the Sea Mother. The guards are wary of anyone, including other kuo-toa, due to recent tensions.

Ploopploopeen claims a small hovel adjacent to the shrine, where he is attended by four kuo-toa. This is where he brings the characters if they are his “guests.”
Treasure

The home of the archpriest contains a closet full of “offerings” taken from less fortunate travelers or culled from the depths of the lake. This includes 500 cp, 2,000 sp, 150 gp, 27 pp, a strand of matched pearls worth 1,000 gp total, two potions of healing, a potion of water breathing, and a spell scroll of light.

### 4. Sloobludop - Altar of the Deep Father
When the characters visit the altar of the Deep Father, read the following to the players:

>The idol to Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father consists of a large hide cut roughly in the shape of a manta ray and stretched out on cords between two support poles. A dead, splayed-out manta ray is pinned to the center of the hide. Two dead octopuses are draped across the top, their tentacles pinned and artfully arrayed, their heads tied together and painted with red and blue pigments. The idol reeks of decay, and the broad stone altar below the idol is stained dark with blood.

Six kuo-toa work at the altar, cleaning up and arranging offerings. Klibdoloogut, a kuo-toa whip dedicated to the Deep Father, stands in front of the altar with two kuo-toa monitors. Offerings are usually living creatures killed on the altar, although an offering of one’s own blood also satisfies the whip. Humanoids other than kuo-toa are immediately taken into custody to be brought before the archpriest of the Deep Father, who summarily condemns them to be sacrificed.

Bloppblippodd, a female kuo-toa archpriest of the Deep Father, lives on the bottom floor of a squat hovel near the altar. She is a bloodthirsty sadist absolutely assured that her divine vision will raise her in glory to rule her people. Bound and gagged against the far wall is a duergar prisoner (see “The Offering”).

**Treasure**

Bloppblippodd’s hovel contains wealth accumulated since her rise to power: 1,000 cp, 500 sp, 290 gp, an embroidered silk handkerchief with a spider design worth 25 gp, three azurite gems worth 10 gp each, a duergar-made bronze cup worth 25 gp, and a silver choker with a spider design worth 30 gp.
