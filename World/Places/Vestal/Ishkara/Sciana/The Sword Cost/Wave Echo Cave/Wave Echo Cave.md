# Wave Echo Cave
## Description
Cave in the foothills west of [[Phandalin]] located in [[The Sword Coast]] area of [[Sciana]]

Fifteen miles east of [[Phandalin]], in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, lies Wave Echo Cave. The rich mine of the Phandelverâ€™s Pact was lost five hundred years ago during orc invasions that devastated this part of the North.

In the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the [[Gundren Rockseeker|Rockseeker]] brothers found the entrance.
