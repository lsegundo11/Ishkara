# Stonehill Inn
## Description
Innkeeper [[Toblen Stonehill]]

In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.

This modest inn has six rooms for rent (Sildar Hallwinter takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see “Food, Drink, and Lodging” in the Basic Rules for pricing. (The characters’ other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)

The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established.
