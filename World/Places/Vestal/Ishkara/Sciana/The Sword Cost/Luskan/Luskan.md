# Luskan
## Description
City located in [[The Sword Coast]] area of [[Sciana]].

Luskan, also known as the City of Sails, was a port city at the mouth of the River Mirar on [[The Sword Coast]] North. Luskan, despite the presence of the Ten Towns was considered by many to be civilization's farthest norhtern reach.

Although once a bustling city, in the days prior to the Spellplague, the city would suffer greatly at the hands of Arklem Greeth. The resulting disaster would allow the Spellplague to nearly decimate the city, with it having only a fraction of its former populace. 

the city is officially ruled by the five [[High Captains]], all former pirate lords and each of which led a faction called a "ship" named after its respective captain: Ship Taerl, Ship Baram, Ship Kurth, Ship Suljack and Ship Rethnor.

Some time after 1485 DR, the five High Captains who ruled the city started to conduct legal sea trade across the Sword Coast. They also protected the city and raided the island kingdoms to the west. Secretly, the High Captains were under the sway of [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] and the [[Bregan D'aerthe]].
