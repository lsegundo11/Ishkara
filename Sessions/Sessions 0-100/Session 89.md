# Pre-Session Notes
2 demons have now encountered they party....and they have lived! not of their own wills. both demons have endeavored to control the groups actions...not end them. they have both mentioned [[House Baenre]] and the deal that they have made with [[Mammon]].

This is part of a broader move/coalition with Lolth. Lolth is pissed (really pissed) about [[Jarlaxle Baenre]]'s deal with [[Mammon]]. She has recruited other Devils to try and end the partnership.
