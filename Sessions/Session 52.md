## Secret and Clues

*Check off when revealed.*

1. [[S01-The Baenre Conspiracy]]
    1. [ ] [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] wants to take over [[The Sword Coast]]
    1. [ ] [[Triel Baenre]] wants the party to herself to "one up" [[Jarlaxle Baenre]], her brother
    1. [ ] The [[Bregan D'aerthe]] plan to assasinate [[Dagult Neverember]]
    1. [ ] [[Triel Baenre|Lady D'aerthe]] is actually [[Triel Baenre]]
    1. [ ] The blank book is a map of an unknown cave system in the Underdark.
1. [[S01.02.01-Prisoners]] - What the prisoners know:
    1. [x] There are nineteen drow at the outpost, including [[Triel Baenre]], [[Shoor Vandree]], and [[Jorlan Duskryn]], as well as another priestess named [[Asha Vandree]]. There are also a dozen quaggoths and a number of giant spiders.
    1. [ ] Three drow guards watch the slave pen from the hanging guard tower across the rope bridge, visible through the locked gate.
    1. [x] The cell has some sort of antimagic effect on it (see area 11 for details).
    1. [x] Jorlan the drow warrior suffered disfiguring injuries recently. Before then, he seemed more in Ilvara’s favor. Now Shoor seems to have displaced him.
    1. [ ] Jorlan used to have a wand that shot globs of sticky material able to trap targets. Now Shoor carries it, as another sign of their change in status.
    1. [x] It might be a matter of days or tendays before a contingent from Menzoberranzan arrives to take prisoners back to the drow city.
    1. [ ] Sarith Kzekarit knows a gray ooze lives in the pool. It’s harmless, feeding off waste unless disturbed.
    1. [ ] Sarith Kzekarit knows a supply patrol from Menzoberranzan is a few days overdue, which is unusual
