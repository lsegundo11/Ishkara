# S01.02.06.01-Fight with Esteban
## Basic Info
The party abandoned [[Esteban]] at the entrance to [[Wave Echo Cave]] way back on [[Day 49]]!! [[Esteban]] was basically left for dead by the party, discarded like a disposable diaper. Left to fend for himself with naught but a knife and his will to live, he has scratched out his living day by day. Reverting to a feral state of being he has vowed revenge on [[Sidiqi Adventures|SA]]. Receiving the message from the party via bat messenger has provided the perfect opportunity to extract his pound of flesh 

Secretly he still loves the group but is pretty pissed at them for leaving him behind
