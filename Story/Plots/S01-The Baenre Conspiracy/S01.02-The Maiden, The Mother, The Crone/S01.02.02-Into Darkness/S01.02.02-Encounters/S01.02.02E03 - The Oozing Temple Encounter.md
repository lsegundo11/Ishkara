# Summary
A tremor causes a cave-in and traps the adventurers in a maze of tunnels with no obvious way out. With a dwindling air supply and water rising in the tunnels, the characters are forced to find a means of escape. Complicating matters, part of the maze belongs to a forgotten temple that now serves as the lair of servants of the demon lord Juiblex.

>**THE OOZING TEMPLE: GENERAL FEATURES**
>
>As characters explore the Oozing Temple, keep in mind the following features.
>
>**Light:** Except where specified otherwise, the tunnels and chambers are dark.
>
>**Air:** The air is stale and perceptibly thin. The temple contains enough air for the oozes, plus 160 hours of breathable air for one creature, divided by the number of creatures present. For example, a party of four adventurers has 40 hours of air. Characters who are at rest and not undertaking activities such as moving or fighting consume half as much air.
>
>Once half of the breathable air is consumed, the characters suffer one level of exhaustion (see >appendix A of the Player’s Handbook). For each additional 10 percent of the air used up, the characters suffer one additional level of exhaustion. At 90 percent, the characters are unable to move. When the air is used up, they die. Once the first level of exhaustion sets in, the characters become aware that they are running out of air, and know roughly how much they have left.
>
>A lit torch or its equivalent uses up air as a character does. Briefer but hotter magical effects consume 1 hour of air per die of fire damage per round. For example, a fireball spell that deals 8d6 fire damage consumes 8 hours of air, while a fire bolt that deals 1d10 fire damage consumes 1 hour >of air per use.
>
>**Water** In addition to running low on air, the characters become aware that the tunnels and chambers are filling with water flowing in from area 6. The water rises at a rate of 1 foot per hour, meaning most of the tunnels and chambers will be completely flooded within 10 hours. Areas filled with waist-deep water are difficult terrain for the characters. Once the water is over their heads, they have to swim.

## 1. Boxed In
As the characters make their way through a 10-foot-high tubular passage, a tremor shakes the area and drops part of the ceiling on them. Each party member must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.

Once the dust clears, the characters realize that fallen rock has buried both ends of the passageway. However, a new passage has opened in one of the walls, offering a possible escape route. It’s clear that the route the party was following has been permanently blocked by tons of rubble, and runs the risk of triggering another collapse if the characters attempt to dig out.

## 2. Dripping Death
Whether finished stone or rough rock, the walls of these 10-foot-high areas glisten with dark, dripping water.

Each of these keyed areas holds a gray ooze that pours through cracks in the ceiling to attack any creatures that enter.

## 3. Glabbagool
This area contains the skeletal remains of a drow, along with a dark metal mace and a scattering of coins. However, the characters are quick to notice that these items appear to hover above the stone floor.

All the visible items are trapped within the body of a gelatinous cube named Glabbagool — or at least, that’s what it has chosen to call itself. Unlike most gelatinous cubes, this monster has an Intelligence of 10 (+0) and telepathy out to a range of 60 feet (see the Monster Manual introduction for telepathy rules).

Juiblex’s arrival in the Underdark has granted Glabbagool sentience and awareness. The ooze is genuinely curious about other creatures and wants to learn more about the world. It defends itself if attacked, but doesn’t otherwise try to harm the characters, instead asking who they are, where they come from, and why they have come to the temple.

Other oozes won’t attack Glabbagool, so it can block a passageway to help the adventurers fend them off. However, the cube can’t safely move past characters in a passageway. Glabbagool might ask to accompany the adventurers if it likes or is intrigued by them. Unfortunately, the ooze’s speed of 15 feet means that characters accompanied by it can travel only at a slow place (see “Travel Pace” at the beginning of this chapter).

### Treasure
Glabbagool’s body contains a mace along with 14 ep and the mostly digested body of a drow. It will disgorge the items for the characters if they win its trust.

The mace is a common magic item. While attuned the weapon, its wielder can use an action to make the head of the mace alight with green flame, or use an action to extinguish the flame. While the mace is “lit,” it glows as brightly as a torch and deals an extra 1 fire damage on a hit.

## 4. Pudding Pits
This chamber is divided into four hallways and floored with heavy flagstones, the walls carved with worn and faded bas-reliefs. These show strange, swirling shapes that might be waves, tentacles, or some combination thereof.

### Trap
The squares marked on the map have been undermined, leaving a 10-foot-deep pit beneath each one. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check enables a character to notice that the stone is weakened.

More than 50 pounds of weight on an undermined area causes it to collapse. A creature standing in the area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to grab the edge of the pit, after which the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check to scramble out. On a failed saving throw or a failed check, the creature falls into the pit and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

At the bottom of each pit is a black pudding, which attacks any creature that falls in. If denied a victim, or if it devours a fallen creature quickly, the pudding climbs up the sides to attack any dangling creatures, or to move into the hallway in search of prey.

## 5. Fountain of Madness
This room contains a stone fountain with a raised edge. The basin contains shallow, brackish water. At the center of the pool, the rubble of a broken statue rest atop a pedestal. All that remains recognizable are a pair of clawed stone feet clutching the pedestal’s top. Carved into the walls are seven niches. Water seeps into one niche through a crack in the wall. The two niches that flank it are empty. Strange, formless sculptures occupy the four remaining niches.

The “sculptures” are actually four gray oozes held in magical stasis. They liquefy and attack when any one of them is touched or damaged.

### Treasure
Hidden beneath the dark waters of the fountain are 112 sp, 41 gp, three green-gold bracelets worth 25 gp each, a drow +1 dagger (the hilt has a spider design), a potion of greater healing, and a vial containing oil of slipperiness.

## 6. Water Chamber
Characters approaching this rough-walled cave hear the sound of pouring water. The water enters through cracks in the 10-foot-high ceiling. Given the rate at which the water flows in, the characters can easily conclude that the cracks were caused by the tremor they experienced, and it’s only a matter of time before the water floods the entire complex.

The water rises at a rate of 1 foot per hour until the tunnels are completely flooded. However, chipping away at any of the cracks causes more of the ceiling to collapse, doubling the amount of water pouring into the complex revealing a diverted underground river that is the source of the water. 

### Puzzle
#### The Water Pouring Puzzle
The party must solve the puzzle to reveal a passage up to dry ground.

Three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters. These are initially filled with 8, 0 and 0 liters. In the goal state they should filled with 4, 4 and 0 liters. The puzzle may be solved in seven steps, passing through the following sequence of states (denoted as a bracketed triple of the three volumes of water in the three jugs):

`[8,0,0] → [3,5,0] → [3,2,3] → [6,2,0] → [6,0,2] → [1,5,2] → [1,4,3] → [4,4,0]`

As the party departs the temple the passage closes behind them sealing the rising water. They find themselves in a larger cavern from which they can resume their journey.

### Development
If Glabbagool is with the party, the intelligent gelatinous cube floats upward as the water rises and squeezes through a crack in the ceiling to escape the flooded temple and remain with the characters.

Once the water level rises to the ceiling, the flow is slowed and the characters can swim upward for 30 feet to reach the water’s surface. They find themselves in a larger cavern from which they can resume their journey.
