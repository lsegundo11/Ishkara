# S01.02.01E02-Barraks
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
One drow is present in each of the barracks caves at any time, resting in a meditative trance. A resting drow rises at any significant light or noise, ready to attack.
#### Treasure
The equipment of the resting drow is stored under his pallet: a shortsword, a hand crossbow with a case of 20 hand crossbow bolts, a chain shirt, and a 100-foot coil of silk rope with a small grappling hook at the end.

Each of the six chests in each barracks contains a flask of drow poison used to treat crossbow bolts (see “Poisons” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). One flask has enough poison to treat 20 bolts. Each chest also contains two sets of clothing and 1d4 items from the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook.

- Chest 1: 
    - A small idol depicting a nightmarish creature that gives you unsettling dreams when you sleep near it ([[Lolth]])
    - An old key (opens the door in slave pens!)
- Chest 2:
    - A tooth from an unknown beast
- Chest 3:
    - A silver spoon with an M engraved on the handle
    - Two toy soldiers, one with a missing head
    - An ornate brooch of dwarven design
    - A metal urn containing the ashes of a hero (the Drow Hero [[Drizzt Do'urden]])
- Chest 4:
    - A bag containing forty-seven humanoid teeth, one of which is rotten
- Chest 5:
    - A hilt from a broken sword
    - The deed for a parcel of land in a realm unknown to you
    - A four-leaf clover pressed inside a book discussing manners and etiquette
- Chest 6:
    - A scrap of cloth from an old banner
    - An ancient arrow of elven design
