## Basic Info

### Description
Water pouring down from the waterfall at area 9 forms a 20-foot-deep pool before flowing out into an underground river that travels several miles before spilling into the Darklake. Since the drow take the water they need from the top of the waterfall, they use the pool to dump waste and garbage. Although this fouls the surface of the pool, the constant flow keeps the water beneath the surface clear.

2 gray ooze lurks in the pool’s shallows, blending perfectly with the dark, wet stone. It feeds on the waste dumped into the pool, along with the occasional creature that finds its way into the cavern or falls into the pool.

The inhabitants of Velkynvelve remain unaware that the recent arrival of the demon lord Juiblex in the Underdark has made this ooze particularly aggressive and malevolent. In addition to attacking any creature in the pool, the ooze surges up to 10 feet out of the pool to attack creatures at its edge. When it does so, creatures within 30 feet of the ooze telepathically sense a voice cry out, “Flesh for the Faceless Lord!”
