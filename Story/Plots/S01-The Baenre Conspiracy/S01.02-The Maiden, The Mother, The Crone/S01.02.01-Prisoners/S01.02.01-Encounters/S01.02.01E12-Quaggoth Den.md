# S01.02.01E12-Quaggoth Den
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
Beyond the slave pen and down a set of stone steps, this cave is used as a den by the dozen quaggoths that serve the drow of Velkynvelve. The interior is littered with nest-like mounds of debris and the scattered bones of the quaggoths’ past meals.

These servants of the drow use the den only to sleep and eat, with 1d4 quaggoths resting here at any given time. The quaggoths attack any creature that comes into their den that isn’t a drow, a spider, or one of their kind. They don’t initially attack unknown quaggoths or drow on sight, but they know all those assigned to the outpost and will question strangers. Derendil and Sarith’s status as prisoners is known to them.

#### Notes
