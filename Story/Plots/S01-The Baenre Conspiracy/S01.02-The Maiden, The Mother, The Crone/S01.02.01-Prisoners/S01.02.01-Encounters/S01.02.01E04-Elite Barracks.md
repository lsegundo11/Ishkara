# S01.02.01E04-Elite Barracks
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
The two hanging towers flanking the platform are the quarters of the elite warriors of the outpost, except for the commander’s lieutenant (currently Shoor Vandree) who has his own quarters in the priestess’s tower. Each hanging tower has two chambers, with a rope ladder running between the upper and lower chamber through a zurkhwood trapdoor. The elite warriors have finer furniture, including zurkhwood chairs and small tables around which they sit.

One off-duty drow elite warrior rests in one of the chambers here at any given time. There is a 50 percent chance that one quaggoth is also present, carrying out chores such as cleaning up or delivering water. Either reacts hostilely to intruders, but they might choose to flee and warn the outpost rather than attack, depending on the odds.

#### Treasure
The equipment of the resting drow warrior is stowed beneath his pallet: a shortsword, a hand crossbow with a case of 20 bolts, a chain shirt, and a 100-foot coil of silk rope with a small grappling hook at the end.

Each of the chests in the four chambers contains a flask of drow poison used to treat crossbow bolts. One flask has enough poison to treat 20 bolts. Each chest also contains two changes of clothing, 2d6 sp, 1d8 gp, and 1d4 items from the Trinkets table in chapter 5, “Equipment,” of the Player’s Handbook.
