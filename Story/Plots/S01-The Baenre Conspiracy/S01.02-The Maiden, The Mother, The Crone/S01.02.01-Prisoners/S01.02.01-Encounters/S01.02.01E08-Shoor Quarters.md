## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
The lowermost and smallest chamber of the priestess’s tower belongs to the commander’s lieutenant, the leader of the elite warriors of the outpost. Shoor Vandree, Ilvara’s current favorite, is the present occupant. The area’s former occupant, Jorlan Duskryn, has been displaced to the elite barracks after his recent injuries.

The chamber contains cushions laid out across floor mats, a small carved table with two chairs, and a sturdy zurkhwood chest.

Shoor spends most of his off-duty time in Ilvara’s quarters, attending to his mistress or awaiting her. Unless you wish him to be found here, his quarters are unoccupied.

#### Trap
The chest is locked, and Shoor keeps the key in his belt pouch. The lock is trapped with a poison needle trap. The victim takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more (8 or lower), the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the trap. A character using thieves’ tools can make a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to disarm it. Picking the lock requires thieves’ tools and another successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

#### Treasure
The table holds a pewter pitcher and a pair of matched goblets, worth a total of 1 gp.

The chest contains Shoor’s personal items and clothing, as well as a small purse containing 20 gp, a black velvet mask stitched with silver thread in a spiderweb pattern (worth 25 gp), a set of bone dice engraved with Elvish characters (worth 10 gp), a small black velvet bag containing a spider-shaped onyx brooch (worth 50 gp), and a flask of strong, syrupy blue liquor (worth 10 gp). The liquor leaves anyone who drinks it pleasantly poisoned for 1d4 hours.
