# S01.02.01E10-Guard Tower
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
The fourth hanging tower, connected by rope bridges to the slave pen and the walkway alongside the priestess’s tower, serves as a guard tower for observing the cavern, the western passage, and the slave pen.

The lower chamber of the tower is occupied by two drow and one drow elite warrior on guard duty. It contains a zurkhwood table and three chairs, a smaller side table, and spider-silk webbing set with hooks for hanging equipment.

As at the watch posts, guard duty here is a dull affair, and the guards are usually distracted enough (talking or passing the time with dice games) that prisoners can move or act unnoticed with a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the guards’ passive Wisdom (Perception) score.

The tower’s upper chamber stores extra arms and armor for the outpost. Characters who gain entrance to the armory can easily loot it (see “Treasure”).

#### Treasure
The contents of the armory include the following:

- 6 chain shirts
- 6 suits of studded leather armor
- 6 shields
- 6 hand crossbows
- 20 cases of hand crossbow bolts, each case containing 20 bolts
- 6 shortswords and 10 daggers
- 6 bags of caltrops (20 caltrops per bag)
- 4 100-foot-long coils of silk rope
- 2 building hammers (not usable as weapons)
- 2 bags of iron spikes (10 spikes per bag)
