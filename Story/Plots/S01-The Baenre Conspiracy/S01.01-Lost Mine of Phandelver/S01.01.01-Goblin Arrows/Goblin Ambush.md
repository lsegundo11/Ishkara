# Goblin Ambush
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
Read the following boxed text to start the encounter:

>You’ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.

If you are using the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They’ve been dead about a day, and it’s clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:

>The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.

Four goblins are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.

This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:

- Review the goblin stat block in appendix B. Since the goblins are hiding, you’ll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.
- Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party can’t surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all of the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins: roll one d20 for all of them, add their Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the total to the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. A character whose score is lower than the goblins’ check total is surprised and therefore can’t do anything on his or her first turn in the combat (see “Surprise” in the Basic Rules).
- Use the initiative rules in the Basic Rules to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone’s initiative count on a piece of paper.
- When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins’ stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 9, “Combat,” in the Basic Rules.
- When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.

### Developments

In the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen’s Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins’ trail.

The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the “What the Goblins Know” sidebar below). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the “Goblin Trail” section).

The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to part 2, “Phandalin.” Elmar Barthen (the owner of Barthen’s Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. He recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster (see below) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.

>The party might need to rest after the goblin ambush, depending on how the battle plays out. See the Basic Rules for more information on short rests and long rests.
#### Goblin Trail

After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.

The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.

The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party’s marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.

**Snare**. About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare’s cord. (See the appendix in the Basic Rules for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn’t carefully lowered down takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.

**Pit**. Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn’t detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The pit’s walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.
### Result
Defeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragmaw hideout completes a story milestone. When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.
