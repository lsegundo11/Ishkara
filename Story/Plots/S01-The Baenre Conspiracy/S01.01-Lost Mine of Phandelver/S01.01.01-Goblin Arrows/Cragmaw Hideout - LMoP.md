# Cragmaw Hideout - [[S01.01-Lost Mine of Phandelver|LMoP]] Plot
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
The Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.

The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.

>**ADVENTURE MAPS**
>
>Maps that appear in this adventure are for the DM’s eyes only. A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren’t meant to see—hence the need for secrecy.
>
>Maps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore, not every location needs a map.
>
>When the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, copying what’s on your map while omitting details as appropriate.
>
>**Scale and Grid**. A scale allows you to measure distances and dimensions accurately, which is important for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other things. Indoor maps use grid squares that are either 5 feet on a side or 10 feet on a side.
>
>**Compass Rose**. A compass rose comes in handy when you’re describing locations. For instance, you might need to tell players about “barrels along the north wall” or “the staircase descending to the west.”

#### General Features

The Cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.

**Ceilings**. Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.

**Light**. Areas 1 and 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.

**Rubble**. Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see “Difficult Terrain” in the Basic Rules).

**Sound**. The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren’t listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.

**Stalagmites**. These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see “Cover” in the Basic Rules).

**Stream**. The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.

>**What the Goblins Know**
>
>If the characters capture or charm any of the goblins here, the goblins can be persuaded to divulge some useful information:
>
>-  Fewer than twenty goblins currently dwell in the lair.
>- Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. He answers to King Grol, chief of the Cragmaw tribe, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. (The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It’s about twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.)
>- Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.
>- The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed. The dwarf’s human companion is being held in the “eating cave” (area 6).


### Result
The next stage of the adventure takes place in Phandalin. The adventurers should have plenty of reasons to visit
the town:
- If the characters began with the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, they can be paid by Barthen’s Provisions for delivering the wagonload of supplies.
- If the characters rescued Sildar Hallwinter, the wounded warrior would appreciate an escort to Phandalin (and will pay 50 gp for the service).
- Details contained within the characters’ backgrounds might prompt them to seek out specific NPCs in the town.

It’s also possible that players might decide to do something different, such as striking out in search of Cragmaw Castle (in part 3 of the adventure). If that’s the case, skip ahead to that section.
#### Awarding Experience Points

Exploring the Cragmaw hideout and defeating Klarg and his allies completes a story milestone. Award each character 275 XP. This should provide enough XP for the characters to attain 2nd level.

Level advancement rules for characters are provided on loose sheets included in this set. Hand these sheets to the players, and allow them to advance their characters to 2nd level before continuing the adventure. Make sure they’ve recorded their XP totals on their character sheets.

In the next part of the adventure, you’ll award XP differently. The characters will earn experience points based on the monsters and traps they overcome, the NPCs they interact with, and the goals they accomplish.

If the adventurers come up with a nonviolent way to neutralize the threat that a monster poses, award them experience points as if they had defeated it.
