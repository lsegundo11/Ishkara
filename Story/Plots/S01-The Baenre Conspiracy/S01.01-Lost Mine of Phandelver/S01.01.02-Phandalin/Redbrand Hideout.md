# Redbrand Hideout
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
The Redbrands’ base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands have since expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding slave pens, workshops, and barracks.

If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the dungeon in area 1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the dungeon by way of area 8.

#### General Features

The hideout consists of well-built dungeon chambers with flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.

**Ceilings**. Passages and chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.

**Doors**. All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. They are unlocked unless the text states otherwise. Iarno Albrek (area 12) and a bugbear named Mosk (area 9) each carry an iron key that can lock or unlock every door in the complex.

A locked door can be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

**Secret Doors**. An “S” on the Redbrand Hideout map indicates the location of a secret door.

Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Spotting a secret door from a distance of no more than 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher, whereas a character who takes the time to search the wall can find the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked.

**Light**. Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, refilled every few hours as needed.

>**WHAT THE REDBRANDS KNOW**
>
>If the characters charm or successfully question any of the Redbrands, they can learn the location of their hideout under Tresendar Manor as well as the following useful information:
>
>- The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard known as Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is made of glass. (Only Iarno Albrek and the Black Spider know Glasstaff’s real name.) Glasstaff’s chambers are in the western end of the stronghold (see areas 11 and 12).
>- A mysterious figure called the Black Spider has hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown. The Black Spider has sent bugbears to reinforce the Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see area 9).
>- The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous “eye monster” (see area 8).
>- The Redbrands have a handful of captives in a holding area “near the old crypts,” which are guarded by skeletons (see areas 4 and 5).



### Result
#### Developments

Various papers and notes are stacked neatly on the desk, mostly consisting of Iarno’s written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for more materials for his workshop. The characters also find a letter signed with the Black Spider’s symbol.

>Lord Albrek,
>
>My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the dwarves. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don’t allow them to upset our plans. See that any dwarven maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste. I’m counting on you, Iarno. Don’t disappoint me.

If Iarno is taken into custody, Sildar Hallwinter arranges to have the wizard incarcerated in the townmaster’s hall until he can be safely transported back to Neverwinter. Whether Iarno stands trial for his crimes is beyond the scope of this adventure. The Black Spider is too preoccupied to meddle in the wizard’s fate.
#### Treasure

At the foot of Iarno’s bed is a sturdy, unlocked wooden chest holding the best pickings of the Redbrands’ loot over the last two months. It contains 180 sp, 130 gp, and a silk pouch containing five carnelians (10 gp each), two peridots (15 gp each), and one pearl (100 gp). It also contains two magic items that Iarno brought with him from Neverwinter: a scroll of charm person and a scroll of fireball.

Iarno also wields a staff of defense (see appendix A).
#### Awarding Experience Points

Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party slays Iarno Albrek. Double the XP award if they capture Iarno and deliver him to Sildar Hallwinter in Phandalin.
#### What’s Next?

The next stage of the adventure continues with part 3, “The Spider’s Web,” in which the characters undertake a number of short adventures that advance the story. At some point during part 2, the characters are likely to advance to 3rd level, so make sure the players are keeping track of their XP.
