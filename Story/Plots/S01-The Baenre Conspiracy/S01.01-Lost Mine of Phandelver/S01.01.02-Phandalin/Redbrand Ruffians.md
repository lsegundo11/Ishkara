# Redbrand Ruffians
## Basic Info
### Characters
### Description
Within a day or so of the adventurers’ arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in a number of different ways:

- After speaking with a number of NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house.
- The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter and go straight to “Redbrand Hideout.”
- If the characters show no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in the street. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.

#### Confrontation

If the characters confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, read:

>The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.
>
>One of the thugs spits on the ground. “Well, well,” he snarls. “Here’s a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come here to bark at us?”

If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, read:

>As you head back into the street, you see four armed ruffians waiting for you. All of them are humans wearing grimy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they watch you.
>
>One of the ruffians spits on the ground. “Time for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way.”

Continue the insults and baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters don’t. Neither side is surprised, because it’s obvious that a fight is brewing.

The group consists of four Redbrand ruffians. If three of them are defeated, the last one flees toward Tresendar Manor.
##### Developments

Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can impart useful information. (See the “What the Redbrands Know” sidebar below.) Townmaster Harbin Wester won’t want to keep Redbrand prisoners until he knows the whole gang has been defeated, but the characters can easily persuade or intimidate him into locking up any prisoners they capture for at least a few days.

### Result
If the characters kill the ruffians, most members of the town are grateful. One exception is the townmaster, who fears Redbrand retaliation. Harbin doesn’t punish the characters but warns them not to cause trouble.

Divide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the ruffians.
