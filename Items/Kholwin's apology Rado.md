[[Kholwin]]'s written apology to Rado of [[Rado's Enchanted Caducetorium]] as an apology to the threat on his life

> I misinterpreted your kindhearted warning to mind our valuables, and I became incensed with the irrational thought that you were somehow threatening to steal our things in the moment. This was clearly wrong, and my ill-mannered threat was entirely uncalled for. I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors, and should there be any way that I might atone for my ass-holery, I would do anything you ask so long as it does not cause harm to anyone of goodly standing. I shall trouble you no more, good Rado.
