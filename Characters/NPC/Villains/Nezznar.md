# Basic Info
Drow (dark elves) are a devious, scheming subterranean race that worships Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders. Drow society is strictly matriarchal. Male drow are relegated to servitor roles, and while most train as warriors, a few, such as Nezznar, become skilled wizards.
## Motivation: 
Nezznar wishes to raise his estem in the eyes of [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] and climb the [[Bregan D'aerthe]] hierarchy.
## Goal:
Kill the party and ingratiate himself to [[Jarlaxle Baenre]]
## Conflict:
The party is better at killing his minions then he is at killing the party. Other memebers of the [[Bregan D'aerthe]] are constantly outwitting him and going over his head. if this continues he may strike out on his own.
