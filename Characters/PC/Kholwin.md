# Full Summary:
I never met my father. Shame, really. He was an elf. You know, magic and healing and frolicking in the woods and whatnot. Not that it matters since he "went for a pack of smokes" about five minutes after learning I was on the way. Noble race, indeed. Now mom, on the other hand, is human, and she did exactly what you might expect someone in her situation to do - harbor a grudge against my dad the size of Mount Doom and take it entirely out on me since he's not anywhere to be found. And for what?!? Like it was my fault, right? Like I was some kind of burden? Seriously, she was just fine. Did I tell you she owned one of the most successful businesses not just in our village, but for pretty much as far as the eye could see? Birds. That's right. Big freaking birds. You wouldn't believe the market for those things. Feathers, eggs, meat, hell, even oil, there wasn't a part of those birds you couldn't exploit for a coin or two, and from the time I was big enough to hold a shovel she didn't have to lift a finger for it either because she made me do everything

So, yeah... life was a little rough during my formative years, smacked around and called every name in the book by mom at home, worked like crazy in the bird coop, and razzed by all the other kids in the village for being the half-elf. But I'll tell you, as much as I might complain about it, those birds were the only thing that kept me going all those years. Being with them was the only time I ever had any peace. They were so beautiful. Tall, long slender necks... anyway, that's pretty much how I got to be here doing all this. I got out of that town as soon as I was old enough to go it alone. I spent pretty much my whole childhood getting screwed with for one thing or another and from all sides with nowhere to turn to for comfort other than my birds, and I've vowed to do whatever I can to stand up for the little guy, the underdog, whatever you might call them, I am their champion.

Now I spend my days roaming from town to town eking out a living as best as I can, helping those in need, and trying to get as far away from where I grew up as I possibly can for a whole lot of reasons.

I really did love those birds, though... allegedly.

We don't talk about that.
