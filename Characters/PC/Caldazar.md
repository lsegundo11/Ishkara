# Full Summary:
Wife (no name James working on it working name ElIsande)
Daugther (4-5 yo) and Son (infant)
both killed in plague

High Captain [[Jarlaxle Baenre|Beniago Kurth]] (actually the Drow [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] cursed [[NeverWinter]]/[[Thundertree]] in order to drive trade to [[Luskan]] North of [[NeverWinter]] on the sword coast. Was trying to drive legit trade. Cursed Neverwinter with a series of plagues. one of which cased Caldazar's family to fall sick and die.

Caldazar AWOL to save family. too late fam already dead. talks to cleric in county that did the burial tells him its not a natural plague
Went a little nuts, too much drinking, too much taverns. Found by Sildar, sildar throws him a bone to bring him back

Caldezar was in elite force under command of dude under command on sildar. Sildar thinks special forces training that caldezar has would be good in providing prtection for gundren.

father still alive (old soldier)
mother dead
2 bros 1 soldier (dead in battle) other brother cleric off some where unkown hasnt seen him since in the army
brother died same day that caldezar got news of plague. caldezar wasn't gonna go awol but watching his brother die got his ass moving


6'3" big man. fit soldier. life of war and swinging swords
Avatar that exits is about right
dark hair, light eyes, mustache
looks older than his 32 years (weather and battle worn)

bunch of battle scars
axe slash to his right side that took some time to recover from. nothing debilitating. good survivor, no major injuries

no tattoos.

pretty clean living, belives in virtue (brother cleric, raised as a family in some kinda faith) still has the virtuous impulse but conflicted from some shameful stuff that he did dealing with his grief (whoring, drinking and what not)

how did you wind up in the sleeping dragon?
Caldezar was in a particularly dark moment. drinking heavy. found himself in the Dragon because the clientle were warriors and he felt some kinship with them had the right "feel" to be a place to drinking to foget. He wasn't looking for a job or anything
it had the "right atmosphere" Spotted by Sildar. not hired right away. sildar recognized the look of a man lost. Sildar returns to the dragon and hires caldezar seperatley and told him to follow the group south. caught up with the group as they were fighting the bugbear in cragmaw hideout. Caldezar used special forces training to hideout in the cave and rescue Sildar. Caldezar recognizes that [[Sidiqi Adventures|SA]] are skilled fighters but not a choesive unit and so follows them in to the hideout to save their ass along with sildar.

Caldezar is currently not sure about this group. really uneasy with Kholwin/Reidoth. has known the kind of people who have collected "trophhies" but Raith is fucking weird with it. A little stand offish of Urimus because...tiefling but has figured out that urimus saved him from the dragon and so has a bit of "he must be a good dude". Likes el condor because el condor wears his heart on his sleeve.
