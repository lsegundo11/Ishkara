# Full Summary:
Dad [[Skaris]] longed for a fairly normal life but couldn't really have it because tiefling.
Mom [[Dagoria]]  was 100% dedicated to Skaris. Desperate to please him and make the "Normal" life happen. drove her a little mad. Eventually made a deal with [[Mammon]] (Ruler of [[Minauros]] in [[The Nine Hells]] to trade Urimus for a normal life for her and Skaris. Mammon agreed but was loose with the interpretation of "normal" and transported the whole family to Minauros and took Urimus as a warrior in training as this was "normal" for tieflings.
Skaris hated Dagoria for this but couldn't leave her because of the deal. Secretley nurtured Urimus to be against Mammmon, or at least to leave Minauros. Instructed Urimus to take the training but when he was strong enough to use that training to escape. Urimus agreed. During a skirmash in the Shadowfell Urimus tracked down a Fey and made a deal to be "rescued" from the Nine Hells. The Fey agreed but kept Urimus as gopher in the city of [[Evernight]] (shadow reflection of [[NeverWinter]] on the sword coast). During his time there, combined with training in the bog of Minauros, Urimus is really good on the Coast. During his time as gopher Urimus completed 3 Tasks set by the Fey and earned his freedom. Fey transported him to the SwordCoast near Neverwinter. This has become kinda "home base" for him as it was the first place he arrived in the material plane. keeps coming back here.

First impression of the world sucked because he is a tiefling and everyone is really suspicious of him. Moved into the wild to seek solitude but hated being alone. started looking for some of "his kind" to hang with but ones associated with Demons as opposed to Devils. Evenutally fell in with the Cambion [[Nyphyn Arkanen]] and his clan. failed at a heist because he didn't want to randomly murder people. wound up in a dual with Nyphyn's brother [[Medos Arkanen]]. By sheer luck he killed the cambion and fled the clan. is now being hunted by Nyphyn, his sister [[Uraikir Arkanen]], minions of Mammon and eventually Mammon himself.
