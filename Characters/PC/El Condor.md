# Full Summary:
Dad: Traveling troubadour (luchador) founder of the troop
dad invented the luchador thing using the goliath "strongest is leader" fighting style of leadership
5 older brothers
traveling and wrestling with the troop
also did some adventuring
mostly street tuffs and the like some monsters
Conny was a little to young for the adventureing part
brothers all killed
dad killed trying to track down the unknow culprit
Conny has now taken on that mission
Suspects it was the same killer
(Joe is thinking that it was some kind of monster/vampire/demon thing up DM)
Weird goliath herd as they were relativly kind and willing to help people
Angel S5E06 for reference (no death sentence but wants to avenge brothers and father)
wants the family to be remembered well for wanting to be good

never met the rest of the herd. travled with a band of troubadours(family) that he was just a part of the act.
born with the herd but some kind of issue meant he wasn't supposed to be, mom killed because of it, so the dad packed up and fled
wore the masked to disguise the goliath nature to not scare the crowds of humans. the herd were not luchadors, just the dad and the brothers.
this was just a think to make money at first but dad and bros found a home with the band of troubadors.


El condor is young and idealistic

Physical:
Luchador mask
German eagle kinda with one head and is actually a condor; never takes it off; kinda stinks
7.5' tall
Growing a beard (uncharacteristic for goliaths)
22yo
no tattoos yet (could be a think in the future)
Eyes: Black/dark brown
(Mexican complexion)
Hair: Black

How did el condor wind up in the sleeping dragon?
loved to wrestle but not adverse to working a fighting pit. show fight style for betting
stands out a bit because hes not a mad dog killer. just wants to the money
doesn't fight dirty. tries to be honorable
Pits were at (sponsored by) the sleeping dragon kind of outlet for bored mercanaries
El condor was looking for his first fight there bumped into silday/gundren
seemed like a better oppurtunity than fighting. gets to help folks like his bros; doens't get hit in the face
